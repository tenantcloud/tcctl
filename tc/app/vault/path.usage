for example:

tcctl vault path projects_name/dev/projects_brahch - for use by developers

tcctl vault path projects_name/APP_ENV - for use by servers

where:

projects_name           - project name in git repository
projects_brahch         - current project branch
APP_ENV                 - the value of the variable from the .env project file
