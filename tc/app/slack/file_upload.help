The commands with which we can send slack message with file attachment

for example:

tcctl slack file_upload --channel "#devops" --site-version "$SITE_VERSION" --file "/tmp/filename"

where:

channel            - the name of Slack channel
site-version       - variable from build script
file               - the path for file which will be attach into message
